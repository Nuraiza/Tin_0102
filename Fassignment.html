<h1> 92nd Academy Awards  </h1>

<p>The 92nd Academy Awards ceremony, presented by the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences (AMPAS),<a href="http://www.yahoo.com">here is the link</a> honored films released in 2019 and took place on February 9, 2020, at the Dolby Theatre in Hollywood, Los Angeles, beginning at 5:00 p.m. PST / 8:00 p.m. EST. During the ceremony, the AMPAS presented Academy Awards (commonly referred to as Oscars) in 24 categories. The ceremony, televised in the United States by ABC, was produced by Stephanie Allain and Lynette Howell Taylor and was directed by Glenn Weiss.[2][3] Three months earlier in a ceremony at the Ray Dolby Ballroom of the Hollywood and Highland Center in Hollywood held on October 27, 2019, the Academy held its 11th Annual Governors Awards ceremony.  </p>

<h1> 	Winners and nominees  </h1>

<p>Parasite won four awards including Best Picture, the first non-English language film to win that award.[8][9] Other winners include 1917 with three awards, Ford v Ferrari, Joker, and Once Upon a Time in Hollywood with two awards, and American Factory, Bombshell, Hair Love, Jojo Rabbit, Judy, Learning to Skateboard in a Warzone (If You're a Girl), Little Women, Marriage Story, The Neighbors' Window, Rocketman, and Toy Story 4 with one.[10] The telecast garnered 23.64 million viewers, making it the least-watched Oscar broadcast since 1974 when Nielsen began keeping records of viewership. </p>

<h1> Ceremony information </h1>

<p>Originally in April 2017, the Academy had scheduled the 92nd ceremony for February 23, 2020.[34] However, due to record low television viewership and ratings attained by recent Oscar broadcasts, the AMPAS Board of Governors decided to move the date for the 2020 gala by two weeks to February 9 in hopes of combating awards season fatigue.[35] This marked the earliest date on which the ceremony has been held.[36] Furthermore, in light of the recent success of last year's hostless ceremony that resulted in an improvement in ratings, ABC entertainment president Karey Burke announced the event would proceed without a host for the second consecutive year.[37] Burke stated the ceremony would feature "huge entertainment values, big musical numbers, comedy, and star power". </p>

<h1> Ratings and reception  </h1>

<p>The American telecast on ABC drew in an average of 23.64 million people over its length, which was a 20% decrease from the previous year's ceremony.[5][60] The show also earned lower Nielsen ratings compared to the previous ceremony with 13.6% of households watching the ceremony.[6] In addition, it garnered a lower rating among viewers between ages 18-49 with a 5.3 rating among viewers in that demographic.[61] Futhermore, some media outlets pointed out that the 62nd Grammy Awards that were broadcast on CBS two weeks earlier earned a higher 18-49 demographic rating with a 5.4 figure.[60][62] It earned the lowest viewership for an Academy Award telecast since figures were compiled beginning with the 46th ceremony in 1974. </p>
